# Employee Productivity & Stress Analysis

##  Overview
This project explores how stress factors influence employee productivity using data analytics and machine learning.  
I developed an end-to-end analytical system that identifies patterns in employee behavior, visualizes correlations, and predicts productivity levels based on measurable stress indicators.  

The goal is to help organizations enhance performance and well-being by understanding how workload, working hours, and emotional factors contribute to productivity variations.

## Key Contributions
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns between stress indicators and performance.
- Implemented data preprocessing — handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling for model accuracy.
- Built and compared multiple ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict productivity levels.
- Designed insightful visualizations to show correlations between mental stress, work hours, and productivity.
- Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like R² score, MAE, and RMSE, achieving strong predictive performance.
- Provided data-driven recommendations for improving work-life balance and employee efficiency.

##  What Makes This Project Unique
Unlike generic stress–productivity analysis projects, this work integrates predictive modeling and real-time insight visualization to transform HR data into actionable intelligence.  
It demonstrates both analytical depth and practical application, combining the power of data science and business decision-making — a skill set valuable for data and AI-driven roles.

##  Results
- Found a negative correlation between stress index and productivity score.  
- Identified key parameters — workload, overtime hours, and satisfaction index — as primary predictors.  
- Achieved an R² score of 0.85, proving high model reliability.  
- Recommended strategies that can potentially improve employee efficiency by 15–20% when applied.
