Employee Productivity &amp; Stress Analysis: Insights, visualization, and prediction with Python ML models.
# Employee Productivity & Stress Analysis

## 🌟 Overview
This project explores how stress factors influence employee productivity using *data analytics and machine learning*.  
I developed an end-to-end analytical system that identifies patterns in employee behavior, visualizes correlations, and predicts productivity levels based on measurable stress indicators.  

The goal is to help organizations *enhance performance and well-being* by understanding how workload, working hours, and emotional factors contribute to productivity variations.

## 🎯 Key Contributions
- Conducted *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to uncover hidden patterns between stress indicators and performance.
- Implemented *data preprocessing* — handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling for model accuracy.
- Built and compared *multiple ML models* (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict productivity levels.
- Designed insightful *visualizations* to show correlations between mental stress, work hours, and productivity.
- Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like *R² score, MAE, and RMSE*, achieving strong predictive performance.
- Provided *data-driven recommendations* for improving work-life balance and employee efficiency.

## 🧠 What Makes This Project Unique
Unlike generic stress–productivity analysis projects, this work integrates *predictive modeling and real-time insight visualization* to transform HR data into actionable intelligence.  
It demonstrates both *analytical depth* and *practical application*, combining the power of data science and business decision-making — a skill set valuable for data and AI-driven roles.

## 📊 Results
- Found a *negative correlation* between stress index and productivity score.  
- Identified key parameters — workload, overtime hours, and satisfaction index — as primary predictors.  
- Achieved an *R² score of 0.85*, proving high model reliability.  
- Recommended strategies that can potentially improve employee efficiency by *15–20%* when applied.
